 desc_oriental_civil_war.1: "Our former viceroy, the traitorous Jaspert de Laval saw a chance to usurp our throne with the sudden and unexpected death of our Beloved Emperor Lothar of House of De Lusignan. And so he stabbed us in the back resulting in the fragmentation of our empire as a consequence.\n\nFortunately however, most of our vassals saw through his evil plotting and distanced themselves from his coup leaving him with only the viceroyalty of Egypt. Now with the ascension of Lothar's relative, Rorgon of House De Lusignan to the throne, order has been reestablished, and thus the time has come to bring an end to this false pretender!"

 title_oriental_civil_war.2: "The Oriental Civil War"
 desc_oriental_civil_war.2: "After the sudden death of our Emperor, Lothar of House De Lusignan, our beloved empire started disintegrating as various nobles and lords started to compete against one another for a chance to sit on the vacant throne. And so to restore order and peace, our marvelous Viceroy, Jaspert de Laval took matters into his own hands and declared his ascendancy to the Holy Oriental Throne.\n\nBut fearing that they may lose their power and influence, the greedy and corrupt noblemen of Constantinople made Lothar's distant relative, Rorgon of House De Lusignan, their puppet "emperor". But no matter how fiercely they may fight to keep their unjust rulership, Rorgon and his puppet masters days are numbered. For we are coming for them..."

 desc_hashimid_caliphate.1: "After the fall the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mongols under the initiative of Khan Todogen assumed the mantle as Caliphs of the Muslim Ummah. However as the continuous, never-ending onslaught from the Ruthless Crusaders have proven, the Mongols have failed to protect the Ummah and Islam, their primary duty as Caliphs.\n\nNow with the Mongol Caliphate on the verge of collapse, we, the Hashimid dynasty, blood descendants of the Prophet, have established a caliphate of our own located in the heart of Islam. And so with the support of our brethren, we shall drive away the ruthless invaders from the west and restore the Dar al-Islam to what it once was."

 desc_khwarezmid_events.1: "Despite the greatness of our dynasty, widespread problems have started to become apparent with the way our empire is run.\n\nOur way of supporting the Burghers has lead to the emergence of a new upper class of Oligarchs who now possess influence over every facet of our government. Their growing influence has started to aggravate our nobles and military who have openly declared their dissatisfaction with the situation. If we don't immediately start working towards improving the state of our empire then we are running a very real risk of provoking a rebellion which could spell an end for our dynasty."

 desc_palmyra_events.1: "With the sudden collapse of the Holy Oriental Empire, a power vacuum emerged in the Levant which the influential Palmyrene House of Tremere managed to use to their advantage to establish an independent Iconoclast Kingdom in Palmyra.\n\nRegarding themselves as the rightful successors of Queen Zenobia and the short-lived Palmyrene Empire, the Tremeres aspire to conquer the Levant and restore the empire once more. While such ambitions may seem like a far-fetched dream at first, the inevitable military confrontation between the rebel Emperor of Egypt, Jaspert de Laval and the Oriental Emperor, Rorgon de Lusignan may just prove to be the opportunity needed to turn the dream into a reality..."

If he is doing this under the sanction of his Emperor is not known but if we don't stop him we will almost certainly suffer a substantial loss of land as the seized territory would then fall under the domain of Rorgon.

 desc_hashimid_caliphate.3: "The Jaziratu Al-ʿArab (The Arabian peninsula, literally meaning, The Isle of the Arabs) has since Islam's founding been the heart and religious center of the various Caliphates. And so with our rapid expansion east, it only stands to reason that the eastern parts of the peninsula, along the Persian Gulf, belongs as much to our Caliphate as all the other parts of the peninsula do."

 desc_hashimid_caliphate.2: "Ever since the Rashidun Caliphate's conquest of Egypt (642 C.E) and the Levant (634-638 C.E), these two regions have been core parts of the Arab World. Only when the godless crusaders showed up at the end of the 11th century did this status change. However, with crusader states now fragmenting into small pieces due to infighting, the time has come for Egypt and the Levant to be reclaimed by our great Caliph."

Many great Muslim houses and dynasties haul from Persia, but since the 12th century the land has been ruled by infamous Khwarezmian dynasty, known for letting the Mongol Scourge pass through their lands to sack and pillage our once great Baghdad and briefly rule our lands as occupiers.\n\nFor this cowardice and betrayal, the Khwarazmians will pay as we march across their lands and put it under the control of someone who won't let invaders through the gates..."
